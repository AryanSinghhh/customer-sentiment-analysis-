 Customer Sentiment Analysis
📌 Project Overview
Customer Sentiment Analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based project that identifies and classifies customer opinions from text data into categories such as Positive, Negative, and Neutral.
This project helps businesses gain insights into customer satisfaction, detect issues early, and improve decision-making by analyzing customer reviews, feedback, and social media comments.
🎯 Objectives
Automatically determine customer sentiment from textual feedback.
Visualize sentiment trends for better business insights.
Enable data-driven decisions for customer experience improvement.
📂 Dataset
Source: Customer reviews dataset (e.g., Amazon, Yelp, or custom collected data).
Format: CSV file with columns like Review, Sentiment.
Size: Flexible based on the application.
🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas, numpy – Data manipulation
matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
nltk, spacy – Text preprocessing
scikit-learn – Machine learning model building
Model Used: Logistic Regression (or alternative ML/DL models like Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, LSTM, BERT).
⚙️ Project Workflow
Data Collection – Gather reviews from CSV, APIs, or scraping.
Data Preprocessing – Clean and prepare text (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).
Feature Extraction – Convert text into numerical vectors (TF-IDF or word embeddings).
Model Training – Train classifier on labeled data.
Evaluation – Measure performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Visualization – Plot sentiment distribution and trends.
Prediction – Classify new unseen reviews.
📊 Example Output
Input Review: "The product quality is amazing and delivery was super fast!"
Predicted Sentiment: Positive ✅
Input Review: "Worst customer service I’ve ever experienced."
Predicted Sentiment: Negative ❌

📈 Future Improvements
Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for better accuracy.
Support multi-class emotion detection (e.g., joy, anger, sadness).
Deploy as a web app using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit.
Add real-time sentiment tracking from social media feeds.
